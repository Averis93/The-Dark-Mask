The Dark Mask tells the story of a group of people that got transformed by a mysterious mayor with fake promises and tricks, while they were at a comic book convention. Right after this transformation, the mayorâ€™s game begins in which 6 cosplayers (controlled by 6 video gamers) will be divided in 2 groups of 3 and will have to rescue 3 pieces of a mysterious object (a dark mask) which will give them the chance to get back their freedom.
